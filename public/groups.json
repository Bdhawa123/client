These include hardware devices suitable for consumer production and mass manufacturing, as well as important and pragmatic software products and systems. We will continue the search for these projects in subsequent rounds�please continue your important work developing them. We are reviewing the first round of project proposal submissions. We received 24 proposals that have passed an initial quality screen. Both public feedback, and an expert review with administrative involvement, will be used to determine the outcomes. We will provide a detailed report for proposals that make the final selection.",
