## What are we trying to achieve - our purpose

**Mission**

Help connect people with active civic tech communities so that they may gain access to or co-create technological solutions to combat COVID-19 faster and together. 

**Example**

Personal 3D printers are penetrating local markets potentially creating a distributed manufacturing capacity for visors or medical components. With supplies running low and the potential for supply chain disruption, putting connecting capacity (local 3D printing groups) with the people in need could save lives. 

**Solution**

We aim to create a solution that supports the above scenario and ensure that data is maintainable over time as new groups and resources are added.



## The technical solution

We are essentially building a catalog and filling it with qualified and known groups that might help and are interested in helping efforts against COVID-19.

The catalog is made available through a website ensuring that the data is accessible.



## Communication - mainly on Slack

As we are moving fast, open (and fun) communication is key. For that purpose we leverage Slack. If you are new to Slack then I suggest you spend 8 minutes watching this video to introduce you to the basic terms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s69uoRkm0WE 



### Slack etiquette

- If you have a question, and you think “Well this must have been asked before?!?” then try searching for it.
- Transparency matters, so most conversations should happen in public channels so that they’re searchable by all members.
- Consider carefully when to use “Threads” and remember to share conclusions in the channel.
- Be polite and use sarcasm carefully if at all.



### Slack tips

- Get the Slack App on your phone
  - Review and disable some Slack notifications on your phone :-)
- Try /Giphy - maybe in the #family channel if you wanna go nuts
  - You can /collapse all open gifs if it gets a bit much
- Use /polly for polls - it is an easy way of getting votes or preferences from a channel
